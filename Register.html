    Finally, by registering the software, you provide us with the resources and 
    incentive to support the software with updates and to develop additional quality 
    shareware products in the future. <br>
    <br>
    Upon registration: <br>
    - you gain access to all levels <br>
    - and to all functions of the game <br>
